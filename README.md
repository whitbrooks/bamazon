## What it does:

1. uses Node and SQL to get product data from a database
2. displays a table for the user
3. prompts user to select an item to purchase and a quantity of that item
4. compares user input to data in database. if there is sufficient inventory, the purchase is completed and the user sees the total cost of their purchase
5. if there isn't sufficient inventory, the user is prompted to start over
6. updates database
